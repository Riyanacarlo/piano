# Virtual Piano
INTRODUCTION:

 This project is an attempt to demonstrate the use of an alternate medium for creating music using gestures .This makes it available to a large number of users. A virtual piano is an application designed to simulate playing a piano on a computer or a mobile phone or tabs. This is developed because it is not possible to carry a large piano everywhere needed and hence it is easily accessible. Also it can be used as a learning tool. The goal is to engage people of all ages to nurture a passion for music.
 

PROBLEM   STATEMENT:

We are going to replace a large and expensive piano with the virtual one. It is much economical and cheaper so that every music lover can access it easily.


PROCEDURE:

We are using keys to play the virtual piano. If we press a particular key, the tune assigned to that key is going to be played.
